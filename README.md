## TASK 2

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 11.2.14.

- Download or clone the code from this repository. If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.
- Navigate to the media-library folder. There should be a package.json file in this folder.
- In a command window type npm install. This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder.
- Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
